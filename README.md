Topic analyser

This tool will allow you to detect whether a set of documents are “about” the same topic or not.
The tool will analyse the words in each document – and decide what the most common words are in
each document. 
“Stop” words should be excluded from the analysis (this is the list of words that don’t really add
meaning which are not included in the similarity measure – such as “the”, “a”, “of” “he”.. etc. 
To select documents through a “File Chooser” GUI, with graphical results
rather than just console.
Allowing words which appear on the list as common across documents - but which are
obviously not informative about the topic – to be added to the stop word list, and the analysis
re-run.
